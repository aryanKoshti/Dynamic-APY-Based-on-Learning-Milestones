# Dynamic APY Based on Learning Milestones

## Project Title
**Dynamic APY Based on Learning Milestones**

## Project Description
The **Dynamic APY Based on Learning Milestones** project is designed to incentivize users for their learning efforts through financial rewards. The system works by rewarding users with **ERC20 tokens** based on the time they spend learning. The rewards are determined by a **dynamic Annual Percentage Yield (APY)**, which increases as the user completes learning milestones. These milestones are set for every **100 hours** of learning, and with each milestone, the APY multiplier increases, providing more rewards for further progress.

The project gamifies the learning experience by offering users **cryptocurrency rewards** for education, making the process of learning more engaging and rewarding.

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to create a **decentralized learning ecosystem** where users are rewarded for their efforts and time spent learning. By incorporating blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi), we aim to build an educational platform that makes learning both enjoyable and financially rewarding.

This project envisions a future where individuals can continually improve their knowledge while also gaining **financial incentives** for their personal development. As users achieve milestones, they will be further motivated to continue learning to unlock additional rewards, contributing to the growth of a **knowledge-driven economy**.

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic APY Based on Progress**:  
   The APY multiplier increases as the user hits learning milestones (e.g., every 100 hours of learning). For example, a 10% increase in APY occurs for each milestone.

2. **ERC20 Token Rewards**:  
   Users earn rewards in the form of **ERC20 tokens**, which can be used within the ecosystem or traded on external exchanges.

3. **Milestone-Based Learning**:  
   The system tracks the user's learning progress in hours. For every **100 hours of learning**, a new milestone is reached, and the user's APY multiplier increases, resulting in higher rewards.

4. **Blockchain Transparency**:  
   All user progress, rewards, and milestone achievements are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability of data.

5. **Fair and Scalable Incentive Model**:  
   The reward calculation is based on **time spent learning**, ensuring that users are fairly compensated for their effort and encouraging continued participation.
